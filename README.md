# GitHub Actions In Action

GitHub Actions is a powerful continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

## What Are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions helps you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. Some key features include:

- Automated building and testing of code
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Code review automation
- Package publishing
- And much more!

### 3. Jobs
- Basic units of work in a workflow

# GitHub Actions In Action

GitHub Actions is a powerful continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository.

## What Are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions helps you automate tasks within your software development life cycle. Some key features include:

- Automated building and testing of code
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Code review automation
- Package publishing
- And much more!

## Key Concepts

### 1. Workflows
- YAML files stored in `.github/workflows` directory
- Define automated processes
- Triggered by events in your repository

### 2. Events
Common events that can trigger workflows:
- Push
- Pull request
- Issue creation
- Scheduled events
- Manual triggers

### 3. Jobs
- Basic units of work in a workflow
- Run in parallel by default
- Can be configured to run sequentially
- Execute on runners (virtual machines)

### 4. Actions
- Reusable units of code
- Can be created by:
  - You
  - The GitHub community
  - GitHub itself
